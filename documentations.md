## Notes
I will create another repl project specifically for the server. This repl project would be client side.

Everything below are links to documentations for reference.

# **Serverside**
Serverside set up by Elijah. It's in a different repl project.

# **A-Frame**
Would probably check which platform the user is currently on, and then set the corresponding controls to be used.
